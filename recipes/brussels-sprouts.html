        <li>1 ½ pounds Brussels sprouts, ends trimmed and yellow leaves removed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place trimmed Brussels sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal tightly, and shake to coat.</li>
        <li>Pour onto a baking sheet, and place on center oven rack.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, shaking pan every 5 to 7 minutes for even browning. Reduce heat when necessary to prevent burning.
